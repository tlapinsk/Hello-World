# Hello-World
First repository on GitHub.

Hey everyone,

Tim here with my first repository on GitHub. Went for a 10 minutes tempo run this morning (I guess I like to exercise) and now sitting down start my first Rails project. Well, time to get started after finishing up this short GitHub tutorial.

Cheers,
Tim
